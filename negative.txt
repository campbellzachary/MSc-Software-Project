he punched me in the face and i started crying.
this is probably the worst night of my life, it couldn't get much worse.
how come i'm single and everyone has boyfriends, life isn't fair
:( im pregnant and i'm only 14 what am I going to do
i got fired from work today
everyone has friends but me, i'm so lonely
i got sick everywhere, i drink too much.
i was a drunk mess and got kicked out of the club.
i'm addicted to drugs and i cant help myself.
no one will ever love me i am a mess who needs professional help
my cat died and i have never felt so sad in my life
the house is not great
i've made too many mistakes in my life
help me from myself
this is a terrible party
